# keyboard

This project is just a collection of my various keyboard layouts.  Currently, these are all VIA layouts.

I switch between macOS, Linux, and Windows regularly - these layouts are meant to be "universal" so that I don't have to burn a bunch of muscle memory to switch between OSes and get stuck with wrong keybinds.

There's no much else to say, use them if you like them, or don't :)
